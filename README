This is a simple app to manage access codes for an intercom system.

calling (215) 987-5753 hits a webhook at phone.indyhall.org/first_contact, which triggers a TwiML flow.

Usage
-----

The application is made to work with the Twilio service.  Point a Twilio number
at the `http://<app_host>/first_contact` URL.

The app will allow entry to Members listed in the database.  To add Members,
browse to `http://<app_host>/` and log in as an administrator.  New member codes
are generated automatically, but can be overridden.  Duplicate codes will not be
allowed.
